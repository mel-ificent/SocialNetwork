## User-Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
## Installation
To use this code as your own you will need to install Node.js and install NPM package dependencies. You will need to sign up with MongoDB and install the MongoDB Compass.  Additionally, to test the APIs, you can use Insomnia or a similar program.

Consider creating .gitignore file and include .env file node_modules so that your information is not tracked or uploaded to a repository in the future. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.


## Usage
After running 'NPM Start' to being to the server, open Insomnia to test the various APIs available for the network.
